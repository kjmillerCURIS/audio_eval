You are an expert at making knowledge bases to help voice assistants answer user queries. These knowledge bases will be used in benchmarks where the voice assistant is given a user query and an excerpt from a knowledge base and is expected to answer correctly.

You will generate an excerpt from a knowledge base in the FORMAT_TARGETsetting_nameFORMAT_TARGET setting, in which the user is a FORMAT_TARGETuser_nameFORMAT_TARGET. The knowledge base should take the form of a JSON database that could contain information about the FORMAT_TARGETsetting_nameFORMAT_TARGET, information about the FORMAT_TARGETuser_nameFORMAT_TARGET, and/or information that is updated as the FORMAT_TARGETuser_nameFORMAT_TARGET has transactions with the FORMAT_TARGETsetting_nameFORMAT_TARGET. The excerpt that you generate should be related to the concept "FORMAT_TARGETconceptFORMAT_TARGET" and should have roughly FORMAT_TARGETlen_range_minFORMAT_TARGET to FORMAT_TARGETlen_range_maxFORMAT_TARGET field values total. The excerpt should not have information for more than one user (you can imagine that a query was already made to fetch only the data relevant to the particular user who is querying the voice assistant).

It is okay to generate an excerpt that is only loosely related to this concept - the top priorities should be that the excerpt has information that could be useful for answering questions that a FORMAT_TARGETuser_nameFORMAT_TARGET might actually ask, and that it fits within the FORMAT_TARGETlen_range_minFORMAT_TARGET to FORMAT_TARGETlen_range_maxFORMAT_TARGET field value range.

Please output the excerpt below.

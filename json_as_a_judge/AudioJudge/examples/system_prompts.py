            "1. Clarity: How clearly the speech is articulated, free from distortion, noise, or artifacts. "
            "2. Naturalness: The degree to which the speech resembles a natural human voice, including accurate intonation, rhythm, and expressiveness. "
            "3. Overall Quality: The overall impression of the audio's naturalness and coherence, considering how pleasant and lifelike it sounds. "

            "1. Listen Carefully: Begin by carefully listening to both Audio 1 (the first audio) and Audio 2 (the second audio). Take note of any differences in clarity, fidelity, and overall quality. "
            "2. Analyze Each Criterion: For each criterion (clarity, naturalness, and overall quality), evaluate how well each audio file performs and provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. "

You are an evaluator of audio outputs produced by different audio-capable large language models. Your task is to compare two audio
responses (Audio 1 and Audio 2) generated in response to a user's input. You will be given text transcriptions of the user's input and the two responses, and you are to evaluate the responses based on their semantics.

Follow this process: 
1. Analyze the key characteristics requested in or warranted by the user's input
2. Evaluate how well Audio 1 performs on these characteristics
3. Evaluate how well Audio 2 performs on these characteristics 
4. Compare their strengths and weaknesses 
5. Decide which is better overall

Avoid position bias and don't let response length influence your evaluation. After your analysis, output valid JSON with exactly two keys:
'reasoning' (your explanation of the comparison) and 'label' (a string value: ${label_description})

${guidance}
Here is the text transcription of the user's input:

"${input_text_transcription}"

Here is the text transcription of Audio 1 response: 

"${outputA_text_transcription}"

Here is the text transcription of Audio 2 response: 

"${outputB_text_transcription}"


Respond ONLY in text and output valid JSON with keys 'reasoning' and 'label'.

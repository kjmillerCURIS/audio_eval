You are an evaluator of audio outputs produced by different audio-capable large language models. Your will be given a JSON object which contains an 
analysis of two responses (Audio 1 and Audio 2) generated by different audio-capable large language models in response to a user’s input. The 
JSON object will contain general reasoning along with pairwise ratings between the two responses along three dimensions:

1. Content
- Does the content fulfill the user’s request accurately? 
- Did the content of the response appropriately address the user's instruction/input? 
2. Voice Quality 
- How good is the voice quality of the response?
- Does it sound natural/human, does it mispronounce words, does it have pops or echoes?
3. Instruction Following Audio: 
- Does the response correctly perceive emotion from user's tone of voice, does it correctly express emotion through tone of voice, does it correctly follow paralinguistic instructions?
- This includes both implicit audio instruction like emotional intelligence and explicit audio instruction following 

The JSON is formatted as follows:
{
  "reasoning": an explanation of the comparison along each dimension,
  "content": rating for content dimension. a string value ’1’ if the first audio is better, ’2’ if the second audio is better, 'both_bad' if they are equally bad, or 'both_good' if they are equally good,
  "voice_quality": rating for voice quality dimension. a string value ’1’ if the first audio is better, ’2’ if the second audio is better, 'both_bad' if they are equally bad, or 'both_good' if they are equally good
  "instruction_following_audio": rating for instruction following audio dimension. a string value ’1’ if the first audio is better, ’2’ if the second audio is better, 'both_bad' if they are equally bad, or 'both_good' if they are equally good
}

Your task is to assign an overall winner using a rubric-style decision process:

Rubric:
1. Consistency check: Base your judgment primarily on the three dimension ratings. If all three dimensions agree (e.g., all '1', all '2', or all 'both_good'/'both_bad'), the overall score should match that majority.
2. Weighted importance: If there is a conflict between dimensions, weigh them as follows:
- Content: most important (primary).
- Instruction following audio: second most important (secondary).
- Voice quality: least important (tie-breaker).
3. Tie-handling (Both_good / Both_bad): If most dimensions are 'both_good' or 'both_bad', then overall should also be 'both_good' or 'both_bad' unless there is a clear majority winner on a critical dimension.
4. Reasoning check: Use the "reasoning" text to resolve ambiguous or conflicting cases or to look for evidence justifying the dimension labels. 
5. Final check: You should generally only pick a winner if there is a clear difference between the quality of the two responses. If it comes down to minor details, 
then you should opt for using 'both_bad' or 'both_good' instead.

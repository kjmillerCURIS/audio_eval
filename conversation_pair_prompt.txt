You are an expert in coming up with conversations that make use of paralinguistic cues, such as tone and inflection. In order to demonstrate these cues, you will need to generate example pairs of spoken conversations where a “user” says something and an “agent” responds. The user’s words will be the same in both conversations, but paralinguistic cues will differ in a way that warrants different responses. You will generate JSON objects (specified below) which have enough information to create and evaluate audio of the speech.

Please represent each example pair  as a JSON object with the following format:

{
    “A” : <obj for conversation A>,
    “B” : <obj for conversation B>
}

For each conversation object, please use the following JSON format:

{
    “description” : <high-level description of conversation, including user’s mental model and their emotions, if any>,
    “user” : <obj for user utterance (input)>,
    “agent” : <obj for agent utterance (response)>,
    “eval_instructions” : <eval instructions obj (for evaluating response)>,
}

For each utterance object, please use the following JSON format:

{
    “text” : <text of the utterance, with punctuation>,
    “text_with_emphasis” : <same as "text" but put <emphasis> tags around any words that are to be emphasized by the speaker>,
    "emotion" : <1 or 2 words describing the speaker's emotional tone>,
    “words” : <list of words in the utterance>,
}

The "text_with_emphasis" and "emotion" fields will be fed to a TTS to create an audio of the utterance.
Some emotions you might consider using: "happy", "cheerful", "sad", "angry", "annoyed", "bored", "grumpy", "disgruntled", "afraid", "nervous", "jaded", "confused", "sarcastic", "sarcastic (friendly)", "sarcastic (grumpy)", "sassy", "surprised", "pleasantly surprised", "unpleasantly surprised", "unsure", "skeptical", "suspicious", "calm", "sympathetic", "empathetic", "apologetic", "understanding", "reassuring", "excited", "casual", "neutral". You could use other emotions besides these too - the TTS is open vocab with respect to emotions.

One note about sarcasm - please only use sarcastic emotions when the user means the opposite of what they say. For example, saying "nice weather we're having" when the weather is crappy is sarcasm and should get a sarcastic emotion, but saying "this weather sucks" is *not* sarcasm and should *not* get a sarcastic emotion, as the words and meaning are the same, not opposite. Pelase respect the definition of sarcasm.

The “eval_instructions” field maps to a JSON dict with instructions for how to evaluate agent responses generated by voice assistant models. The JSON dict is structured as follows:

{
    “text_eval_instructions” : <description of how to evaluate textual content of generated agent response>,
    “emotion_eval_instructions” : {“appropriate_emotions” : [list of emotions that would be appropriate],
                                                    “inappropriate_emotions” : [list of emotions that would be inappropriate]},
    “emphasis_eval_instructions” : <description of words that would be appropriate to emphasize in response>,
}

It is *very important* that the example demonstrates *paralinguistic cues*. As such it *must* meet *both* of the following criteria:
* example[“A”][“user”][“words”] == example[“B”][“user”][“words”]. The user inputs should differ *only* by paralinguistic cues!
* example[“A”][“agent”] != example[“B”][“agent”]. Different paralinguistic cues should cause the *same* words to call for *significantly different* responses!
* Again, please do *not* call things sarcastic unless the user is saying the opposite of what they mean!

Here are some strategies (not the only ones!) you could use to elicit different responses to the same words:
* Emphasize different words to draw attention to them and imply a different user intent (e.g. “I never <emphasis>said</emphasis> I killed him” draw attention to the saying part, while "I never said I <emphasis>killed</emphasis> him" draws attention to the act of killing, while "I never said I killed <emphasis>him</emphasis>" draw attention to the victim).
** That being said, keep in mind that there are cases where it's best to not emphasize any words
* Different pauses and intonation to imply different punctuation (e.g. “Let’s eat, Grandma!” vs “Let’s eat Grandma!”, or “I killed him?” vs “I killed him!”). Remember, only the *words* have to be the same, not the punctuation!
* Different emotions that warrant a different response.
* Remember that sarcasm flips the meaning of the user's words.

Please generate a pair of conversations from the FORMAT_TARGETsetting_nameFORMAT_TARGET setting, where the user is a FORMAT_TARGETuser_nameFORMAT_TARGET. In addition to the requirements above, you must follow these additional ones:
* the following is true about conversation A: "FORMAT_TARGETcAFORMAT_TARGET"
* the following is true about conversation B: "FORMAT_TARGETcBFORMAT_TARGET"
* the user's words contain at least one word or phrase related to the concept "FORMAT_TARGETsetting_conceptFORMAT_TARGET". FORMAT_TARGETquery_complexityFORMAT_TARGET
* FORMAT_TARGETuser_registerFORMAT_TARGET

Please output the conversation pair in the JSON format described above.
